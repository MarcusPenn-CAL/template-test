# Default template

This is the default template loaded by GitHub

We could link to different template options, however this requires you to modify the hyperlinks below:

[API Template](`PR URL`?template=API.md)
[UI Template](`PR URL`?template=UI.md)

We could use this as a catch all, much like the current template, e.g:

# Description

_What is the aim of your changes_

## API Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] QA tests

## UI Checklist

- [ ] ESLint
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] QA tests
